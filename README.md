Laboratory Activity #4: Arduino Serial Connection

Objectives:
- Understand and implement Arduino Serial Connection
- Utilize and familiarize students on different basic Serial connection functions
- Create a simple circuit that can be controlled using Serial connection

Instructions:
Using the diagram and code base used for Laboratory Activity 3, fulfill the following:
1. Choose one (1) sensor to be used in this activity
2. If using thermistor, set the temperature threshold to 50 Celsius. If using photoresistor, set the brightness threshold to 220.
3. If the threshold is met, blink the LED in pin 8 (delay = 100) AND SHOULD continue to blinking even after the sensor reading is below threshold.
4. If the word "stop" is entered in the Serial Monitor, the blinking should stop. The word should be case insensitive (can enter stop in different cases)
